Work in progress 

This is an addin for outlook classic and perhaps the new Outlook 365, with the intention of making it possible to customize scheduled out of office.

example senario: every otherweek you have a day off. so Bi-weekly you need to have an out of office message to contact your colleagues and you dont want to have to remember to manually enabling it every time you need it.
